### Methodology: Identifying Conservation Gaps
We a conservation gap analysis framework to inform collection actions and the state of the metacollection for a specific species. This process evaluates the extent to which *ex situ* (genebank/living collection), are present across the estimated distribution of the species.

#### Key Metrics
We calculate three primary scores to evaluate conservation status:
* **Sampling Representativeness Score (SRS):** Compares the total number of reference(H) occurrences to the number of *ex situ* accessions (G).
* **Geographic Representativeness Score (GRS):** Measures how well the physical area of the species' range represented by buffered around all observations is covered by *ex situ* accessions (G).
* **Ecological Representativeness Score (ERS):** Determines if the collections *ex situ* accessions (G) cover the full range of ecoregions that species is expected to occupy.

#### How to Interpret Results
The results are aggregated into a **Final Conservation Score (FCS)** ranging from 0 to 100.

| Score Range | Priority Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0 - 25** | **High Priority** | Species is critically under-represented in collections. Urgent action required. |
| **26 - 50** | **Medium Priority** | Some representation exists, but significant gaps remain in specific regions or ecotypes. |
| **51 - 75** |**Low Priority** | Species is adequately represented, though targeted collecting may still be beneficial. |
| **76 - 100** |**Sufficient** | Species is well-conserved *ex situ*. |
