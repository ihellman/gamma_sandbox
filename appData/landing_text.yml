summary: 
  text1 : "GAMMA evaluates the extent to which a living collection for a taxon is representative of its wild diversity. Living collections managers and curators at botanic gardens and similar organizations can use this app to assess how much wild diversity is or is not represented in a living collection or metacollection for a species. Areas of wild distribution not represented in a living collection, the gaps, can be prioritized for collection to bring more diversity into the collection."
  text2 : "The app includes taxon-level data currently in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), a publically-accessible database. Accessions data for a living collection is provided by app users for the purpose of a single analysis, and is not stored within the application."
